This project is meant to unveil any sort of insights from my data exploration. This project, which is a component of Udacity's Nanodegree (Data Analyst). This projects aims to examine the Prosper Loans dataset and produce useful insights.

# Dataset
This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. See the link for the dataset and its description [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit?usp=sharing).

# Summary of Findings

To fully understand the distribution and relationships that currently exist in the dataset, I have conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. My project concentrated on the relationships and causes between loan amounts and credit scores.

From the variables of interest, I found out that CreditScore Status is the major factor during loan application. I found out that, approximately 53.76% of loan applicants have good credit, followed by 18.52% of applicants with fair credit. The percentage of applicants with exceptional credit score status, however, was nearly equal to the percentage of applicants with terrible credit score.

In addition, the relationship between loan amount and investors was positive ie (0.38). This makes sense since  each investor has the option to contribute a different amount to the total, the number of investors who participate might affect the loan amount. The loan amount may increase with the number of investors who join.


Also, your Employment Status and Debt-To-Income Ratio helps you to have a lower APR. Evenly, being a homeowner is helpful to get a higher loan amount, which is not surprising since higher incomes are more likely to have a property, and a better credit score.


# Key Insights
As advice to future loans applicants, make sure you have a good credit score and you are employed. It likely that you will be classified based on your credit score, employment status, income, and the reasons for the  loan application. The approval of the loan as well as the APR and the terms will depend on those variables.
