# Welcome! 

A collection of my projects for ALX-Udacity-Scholarship-Program 

## Courses

* Introduction to Data Analysis with Python
  * The Data Analysis Process 
  * Explore data through a process of inquiry using the NumPy and Pandas libraries
  * Analyze and visualize data using numerical statistics and Matplotlib built-in functions
  * Evaluate data by customizing visualizations to clearly and effectively communicate your findings
  
* Data Wrangling with Python
  * Introduction to Data Wrangling
     * Identify each step of the data wrangling process (gathering, assessing, and cleaning).
     * Wrangle a CSV file downloaded from Kaggle using fundamental gathering, assessing, and cleaning code
  
  * Gathering Data
     * Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files, programmatically downloading files, web-scraping data, and accessing data from APIs.
     * Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files.
     * Store gathered data in a PostgreSQL database.
     
   * Assessing Data
     * Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
     * Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues)
     * Identify data quality issues and categorize them using metrics: validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity
 
   * Cleaning Data
     * Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding, and testing)
     * Clean data using Python and pandas
     * Test cleaning code visually and programmatically using Python
